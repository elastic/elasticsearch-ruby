[[transport-api]]
=== Transport and API

The `elasticsearch` gem combines two separate Rubygems:

* https://github.com/elastic/elastic-transport-ruby/[`elastic-transport`]
provides an HTTP Ruby client for connecting to the {es} cluster.

* https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/main/elasticsearch-api[`elasticsearch-api`]
provides a Ruby API for the {es} RESTful API.

Please consult their respective documentation for configuration options and technical details.

Notably, the documentation and comprehensive examples for all the API methods are contained in the source, and available online at http://rubydoc.info/gems/elasticsearch-api/Elasticsearch/API/Actions[Rubydoc].

Keep in mind, that for optimal performance, you should use an HTTP library which supports persistent ("keep-alive") HTTP connections.
