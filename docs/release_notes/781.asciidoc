= 7.8.1 Release notes


[discrete]
== Client

- Support for Elasticsearch version `7.8.1`.
- Bug fix: Fixed a bug on the API endpoints documentation for RubyDocs: there 
  was an unnecessary empty new line in the documentation for parameters that 
  have options. So the parameters before that empty newline were not being 
  documented in RubyDocs.

  enterprise license is installed, return the type and mode as 'enterprise' 
  (default: false).
