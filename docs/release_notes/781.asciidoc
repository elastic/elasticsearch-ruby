= 7.8.1 Release notes

== Client

- Support for Elasticsearch version `7.8.1`.
- Bug fix: Fixed a bug on the API endpoints documentation for RubyDocs: there 
  was an unnecessary empty new line in the documentation for parameters that 
  have options. So the parameters before that empty newline were not being 
  documented in RubyDocs.

== X-Pack

=== API Changes

- Update to `info` endpoint. New parameter `accept_enterprise` (boolean): If an 
  enterprise license is installed, return the type and mode as 'enterprise' 
  (default: false).
