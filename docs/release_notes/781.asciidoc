=== 7.8.1 Release notes

[discrete]
=== Client

- Support for Elasticsearch version `7.8.1`.
- Bug fix: Fixed a bug on the API endpoints documentation for RubyDocs: there was an unnecessary empty new line in the documentation for parameters that have options. So the parameters before that empty newline were not being documented in RubyDocs.

=== X-Pack

==== API Changes

- Update to `info` endpoint. New parameter `accept_enterprise` (boolean): If an enterprise license is installed, return the type and mode as 'enterprise' (default: false).
