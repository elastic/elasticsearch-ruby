=== 7.6 Release notes

==== Client

* Support for Elasticsearch version 7.6.
* Last release supporting Ruby 2.4. Ruby 2.4 has reached it's end of life and no more security updates will be provided, users are suggested to update to a newer version of Ruby.

===== API Key Support

The client now supports API Key Authentication, check "Authentication" on the https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/7.x/elasticsearch-transport#authentication[transport README] for information on how to use it.

===== X-Opaque-Id Support

The client now supports identifying running tasks with X-Opaque-Id. Check https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/7.x/elasticsearch-transport#identifying-running-tasks-with-x-opaque-id[transport README] for information on how to use X-Opaque-Id.

===== Faraday migrated to 1.0

We're now using version 1.0 of Faraday:

* The client initializer was modified but this should not disrupt final users at all, check this commit for more information.
* Migrated error checking to remove the deprecated Faraday::Error namespace.
* *This change is not compatible with https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus[Typhoeus]*. The latest release is 1.3.1, but it's https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/blob/v1.3.1/lib/typhoeus/adapters/faraday.rb#L100[still using the deprecated `Faraday::Error` namespace]. This has been fixed on master, but the last release was November 6, 2018. Version 1.4.0 should be ok once it's released.
* Note: Faraday 1.0 drops official support for JRuby. It installs fine on the tests we run with JRuby in this repo, but it's something we should pay attention to.
