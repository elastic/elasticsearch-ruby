=== Elasticsearch DSL

The https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-ruby[elasticsearch-dsl] gem provides a Ruby API for the https://www.elasticsearch.com/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html[Elasticsearch Query DSL]. The library allows to programmatically build complex search definitions for {es} in Ruby, which are translated to Hashes, and ultimately, JSON, the language of {es}.

See https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-ruby#elasticsearchdsl[the README] for more information.
