# Elasticsearch DSL [dsl]

The [elasticsearch-dsl](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-ruby) gem provides a Ruby API for the [Elasticsearch Query DSL](https://www.elasticsearch.com/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.md). The library allows to programmatically build complex search definitions for {{es}} in Ruby, which are translated to Hashes, and ultimately, JSON, the language of {{es}}.

See [the README](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-ruby#elasticsearchdsl) for more information.
