## 7.7.0

This version drops support for Ruby 2.4 since it's reached it's end of life.

### Client

- Support for Elasticsearch version `7.7`

#### Custom Headers

You can set custom HTTP headers on the client's initializer or pass them as a parameter to any API endpoint. [More info and code examples](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/7.x/elasticsearch-transport#custom-http-headers).

### API

#### API Changes

- Clean: Removes up some deprecated endpoints: `abort_benchmark`, `benchmark`, `delete_by_rethrottle`, `nodes.shutdown`, `remote.info`.
- `expand_wildcards` Whether to expand wildcard expressions to concrete indices that are open, closed or both. Options: open, closed, hidden, none, all. `hidden` option is new. It was also added to the following endpoints: `cat.aliases`, `cat.indices`.
- `delete_by_query`: Parameter `slices` can now be set to `auto`.
- `reindex`: Parameter `slices` can now be set to `auto`.
- `update_by_query`: Parameter `slices` can now be set to `auto`.
- `snapshot.cleanup_repository`: Parameter `body` is removed.

#### New API Endpoints

- `cluster.delete_component_template`
- `cluster.get_component_template`
- `cluster.put_component_template`
- `indices.create_data_stream` (experimental)
- `indices.delete_data_stream` (experimental)
- `indices.get_data_stream` (experimental)

### X-Pack

#### API Changes

- `machine_learing.get_trained_models`: New parameter `tags`
- `machine_learning.put_datafeed`, `machine_learning.update_datafeed`: Added parameters `ignore_unavailable`, `allow_no_indices`, `ignore_throttled`, `expand_wildcards`
- `reload_secure_settings`: New parameter `body`, an object containing the password for the keystore.

#### New API Endpoints

- `async_search.delete`
- `async_search.get`
- `async_search.submit`
- `cat.ml_data_frame_analytics`
- `cat.ml_datafeeds`
- `cat.ml_jobs`

## 7.6.0

### Client

- Support for Elasticsearch version `7.6`.
- Last release supporting Ruby 2.4. Ruby 2.4 has reached it's end of life and no more security updates will be provided, users are suggested to update to a newer version of Ruby.

#### API Key Support
The client now supports API Key Authentication, check "Authentication" on the [transport README](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/7.x/elasticsearch-transport#authentication) for information on how to use it.

#### X-Opaque-Id Support

The client now supports identifying running tasks with X-Opaque-Id. Check [transport README](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/7.x/elasticsearch-transport#identifying-running-tasks-with-x-opaque-id) for information on how to use X-Opaque-Id.

#### Faraday migrated to 1.0

We're now using version 1.0 of Faraday:
- The client initializer was modified but this should not disrupt final users at all, check [this commit](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/commit/0fdc6533f4621a549a4cb99e778bbd827461a2d0) for more information.
- Migrated error checking to remove the deprecated `Faraday::Error` namespace.
- **This change is not compatible with [Typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus)**. The latest release is 1.3.1, but it's [still using the deprecated `Faraday::Error` namespace](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/blob/v1.3.1/lib/typhoeus/adapters/faraday.rb#L100). This has been fixed on master, but the last release was November 6, 2018. Version 1.4.0 should be ok once it's released.
- Note: Faraday 1.0 drops official support for JRuby. It installs fine on the tests we run with JRuby in this repo, but it's something we should pay attention to.
