# Rest API YAML Test Runner

The specs in `elasticsearch-api` automatically run the tests from [Elasticsearch's REST API Spec tests](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/main/rest-api-spec/src/main/resources/rest-api-spec/test#test-suite). The test runner is defined in the `spec` folder, starting with the `rest_api_yaml_spec.rb` file.

You can run the tests with Rake. The main task is `rake test:rest_api`. This task will evaluate the `TEST_SUITE` environment variable. It will run either the `free` or `platinum` tests suites depending on the value of `TEST_SUITE`. If you don't set this value, the task will run the `free` test suite by default. To run the `platinum` test suite use:
```
TEST_SUITE=platinum rake test:rest_api
```

Or the shortcut:
```
rake test:platinum:api
```

## REST API YAML Spec

The file that traverses the yaml files and loads a **TestFile** object per each of them:
`elasticsearch-api/spec/elasticsearch/api/rest_api_yaml_spec.rb`

You can use the SINGLE_TEST env variable to run just one test or one test directory. E.g.:
```
$ cd elasticsearch-api && SINGLE_TEST=indices.resolve_index/10_basic_resolve_index.yml TEST_ES_SERVER='http://localhost:9200' be rake test:rest_api
```
And:
```
$ cd elasticsearch-api && SINGLE_TEST=indices.resolve_index TEST_ES_SERVER='http://localhost:9200' be rake test:rest_api
```

## Skipped tests

We sometimes skip tests, generally due to limitations on how we run the CI server or for stuff that hasn't been completely implemented on the client yet. Skipped tests are located in `elasticsearch-api/spec/skipped_tests.yml`. You can run just the tests which are currently being skipped by running:
```
$ cd elasticsearch-api && TEST_SUITE=(free|platinum) RUN_SKIPPED_TESTS=true TEST_ES_SERVER='http://localhost:9200' be rake test:rest_api
```

## TestFile
Class representing a single test file. Contains setup, teardown and tests.   
`../api-spec-testing/test_file.rb`

## Test
Every single test in the test file is represented in the Test object.   
`../api-spec-testing/test_file/test.rb`

## TaskGroup

Tests are ordered in task groups, an array of TaskGroup objects.  
`../api-spec-testing/test_file/task_group.rb`

Task Groups are a representation of a block of actions consisting of 'do' actions and their verifications. e.g.: 
```yaml
 - do:
      index:
          index:  test-index
          id:     1
          body:   { foo: bar }

 - match:   { _index:   test-index }
 - match:   { _id:      "1"}
 - match:   { _version: 1}
```

**Before** each test, the spec runner runs `clear_data` on the test_file. This clears indices, index templates, snapshots and repositories. For platinum it also clears roles, users, privileges, datafeeds, ml_jobs and more.

**After** each test, it runs the test file teardown and `clear_data` again.

For each TaskGroup, it sees what's in the task group definition and runs an expectation test.

## Action

This file is where the action is executed, where we call the client with the method from the test and save the response which is then used in the task group.

## Rest YAML tests Helper

`elasticsearch-api/spec/rest_yaml_tests_helper.rb`

- `ADMIN_CLIENT` is defined here.
- `SINGLE_TEST` is defined here.
- Skipped tests are listed here

## Spec Helper

- `DEFAULT_CLIENT` is defined here

## Enable Logging

To enable logging, set the environment `QUIET` to false before running the tests. In CI, this is located in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/blob/main/.ci/Dockerfile). The environment variable is evaluated in the Rest YAML tests Helper file.

# Features

## RSpec Matchers

The tests use custom [RSpec Matchers](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-expectations/RSpec/Matchers) defined in `api-spec-testing/rspec_matchers.rb`.

From the [Rest API test docs](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/rest-api-spec/src/main/resources/rest-api-spec/test#do):

## `catch`

> If the arguments to `do` include `catch`, then we are expecting an error, which should be caught and tested.

In `rest_api_yaml_spec`, there's a check for `catch_exception?` per task_group. This checks if the `do` definitions have any `catch` definitions. If there is a `catch`, it'll send the request and use the `match_error` RSpec custom matcher to validate the expected error.

## `warnings`

>If the arguments to `do` include `warnings` then we are expecting a Warning header to come back from the request. If the arguments don’t include a warnings argument then we don’t expect the response to include a Warning header. The warnings must match exactly. Using it looks like this:

```
- do:
    warnings:
        - '[index] is deprecated'
        - quotes are not required because yaml
        - but this argument is always a list, never a single string
        - no matter how many warnings you expect
    get:
        index:    test
        type:    test
        id:        1
```
