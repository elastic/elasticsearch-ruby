        # This functionality is Experimental and may be changed or removed
        # completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach
        # to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the

        # @option arguments [String] :task_id Cancel the task with specified task id (node_id:task_number)
        # @option arguments [List] :nodes A comma-separated list of node IDs or names to limit the returned information; use `_local` to return information from the node you're connecting to, leave empty to get information from all nodes
        # @option arguments [List] :actions A comma-separated list of actions that should be cancelled. Leave empty to cancel all.
        # @option arguments [String] :parent_task_id Cancel tasks with specified parent task id (node_id:task_number). Set to -1 to cancel all.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :wait_for_completion Should the request block until the cancellation of the task and its descendant tasks is completed. Defaults to false
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
