        # Reset a transform.
        # Before you can reset it, you must stop it; alternatively, use the `force` query parameter.
        # If the destination index was created by the transform, it is deleted.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :transform_id Identifier for the transform. This identifier can contain lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z and 0-9),
        #  hyphens, and underscores. It has a 64 character limit and must start and end with alphanumeric characters. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :force If this value is `true`, the transform is reset regardless of its current state. If it's `false`, the transform
        #  must be stopped before it can be reset.
        # @option arguments [Time] :timeout Period to wait for a response. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
