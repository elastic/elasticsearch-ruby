        # Get repositories metering information for a cluster.
        # This API exposes monotonically non-decreasing counters and it is expected that clients would durably store the information needed to compute aggregations over a period of time.
        # Additionally, the information exposed by this API is volatile, meaning that it will not be present after node restarts.
        # This functionality is Experimental and may be changed or removed
        # completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach
        # to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the
        # support SLA of official GA features.

        # @option arguments [String, Array] :node_id Comma-separated list of node IDs or names used to limit returned information. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
