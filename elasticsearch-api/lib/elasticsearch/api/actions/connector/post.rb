        # Connectors are Elasticsearch integrations that bring content from third-party data sources, which can be deployed on Elastic Cloud or hosted on your own infrastructure.
        # Elastic managed connectors (Native connectors) are a managed service on Elastic Cloud.
        # Self-managed connectors (Connector clients) are self-managed on your infrastructure.
        # This functionality is in Beta and is subject to change. The design and
        # code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided
        # as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support
        # SLA of official GA features.
