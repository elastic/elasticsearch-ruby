        # Get a connector.
        # Get the details about a connector.
        # This functionality is in Beta and is subject to change. The design and
        # code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided
        # as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support
        # SLA of official GA features.

        # @option arguments [String] :connector_id The unique identifier of the connector (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :include_deleted A flag to indicate if the desired connector should be fetched, even if it was soft-deleted.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
