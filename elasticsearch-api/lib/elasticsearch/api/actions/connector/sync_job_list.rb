        # @option arguments [Integer] :from Starting offset Server default: 0.
        # @option arguments [Integer] :size Specifies a max number of results to get Server default: 100.
        # @option arguments [String] :status A sync job status to fetch connector sync jobs for
        # @option arguments [String] :connector_id A connector id to fetch connector sync jobs for
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :job_type A comma-separated list of job types to fetch the sync jobs for
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
