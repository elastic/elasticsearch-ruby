        # Get the snapshot status.
        # Get a detailed description of the current state for each shard participating in the snapshot.
        # Note that this API should be used only to obtain detailed shard-level information for ongoing snapshots.
        # If this detail is not needed or you want to obtain information about one or more existing snapshots, use the get snapshot API.
        # If you omit the `<snapshot>` request path parameter, the request retrieves information only for currently running snapshots.
        # This usage is preferred.
        # If needed, you can specify `<repository>` and `<snapshot>` to retrieve information for specific snapshots, even if they're not currently running.
        # WARNING: Using the API to return the status of any snapshots other than currently running snapshots can be expensive.
        # The API requires a read from the repository for each shard in each snapshot.
        # For example, if you have 100 snapshots with 1,000 shards each, an API request that includes all snapshots will require 100,000 reads (100 snapshots x 1,000 shards).
        # Depending on the latency of your storage, such requests can take an extremely long time to return results.
        # These requests can also tax machine resources and, when using cloud storage, incur high processing costs.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :repository The snapshot repository name used to limit the request.
        #  It supports wildcards (`*`) if `<snapshot>` isn't specified.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :snapshot A comma-separated list of snapshots to retrieve status for.
        #  The default is currently running snapshots.
        #  Wildcards (`*`) are not supported.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :ignore_unavailable If `false`, the request returns an error for any snapshots that are unavailable.
        #  If `true`, the request ignores snapshots that are unavailable, such as those that are corrupted or temporarily cannot be returned.
        # @option arguments [Time] :master_timeout The period to wait for the master node.
        #  If the master node is not available before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error.
        #  To indicate that the request should never timeout, set it to `-1`. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
