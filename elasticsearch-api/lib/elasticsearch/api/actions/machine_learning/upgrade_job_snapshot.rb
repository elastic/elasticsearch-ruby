        # Upgrade a snapshot.
        # Upgrade an anomaly detection model snapshot to the latest major version.
        # Over time, older snapshot formats are deprecated and removed. Anomaly
        # detection jobs support only snapshots that are from the current or previous
        # major version.
        # This API provides a means to upgrade a snapshot to the current major version.
        # This aids in preparing the cluster for an upgrade to the next major version.
        # Only one snapshot per anomaly detection job can be upgraded at a time and the
        # upgraded snapshot cannot be the current snapshot of the anomaly detection
        # job.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :job_id Identifier for the anomaly detection job. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [String] :snapshot_id A numerical character string that uniquely identifies the model snapshot. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :wait_for_completion When true, the API wonâ€™t respond until the upgrade is complete.
        #  Otherwise, it responds as soon as the upgrade task is assigned to a node.
        # @option arguments [Time] :timeout Controls the time to wait for the request to complete. Server default: 30m.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
        # @see https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/v9/operation/operation-ml-upgrade-job-snapshot
