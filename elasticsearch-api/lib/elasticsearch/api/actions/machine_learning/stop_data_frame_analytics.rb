        # Stop data frame analytics jobs.
        # A data frame analytics job can be started and stopped multiple times
        # throughout its lifecycle.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :id Identifier for the data frame analytics job. This identifier can contain
        #  lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z and 0-9), hyphens, and
        #  underscores. It must start and end with alphanumeric characters. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :allow_no_match Specifies what to do when the request:
        #  - Contains wildcard expressions and there are no data frame analytics
        #  jobs that match.
        #  - Contains the _all string or no identifiers and there are no matches.
        #  - Contains wildcard expressions and there are only partial matches.
        #  The default value is true, which returns an empty data_frame_analytics
        #  array when there are no matches and the subset of results when there are
        #  partial matches. If this parameter is false, the request returns a 404
        #  status code when there are no matches or only partial matches. Server default: true.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :force If true, the data frame analytics job is stopped forcefully.
        # @option arguments [Time] :timeout Controls the amount of time to wait until the data frame analytics job
        #  stops. Defaults to 20 seconds. Server default: 20s.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
        # @see https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/v9/operation/operation-ml-stop-data-frame-analytics
