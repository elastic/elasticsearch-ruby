        # Open anomaly detection jobs.
        # An anomaly detection job must be opened to be ready to receive and analyze
        # data. It can be opened and closed multiple times throughout its lifecycle.
        # When you open a new job, it starts with an empty model.
        # When you open an existing job, the most recent model state is automatically
        # loaded. The job is ready to resume its analysis from where it left off, once
        # new data is received.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :job_id Identifier for the anomaly detection job. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Time] :timeout Controls the time to wait until a job has opened. Server default: 30m.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        # @option arguments [Hash] :body request body
        #
