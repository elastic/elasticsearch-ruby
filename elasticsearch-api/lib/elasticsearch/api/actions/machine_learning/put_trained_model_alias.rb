        # Create or update a trained model alias.
        # A trained model alias is a logical name used to reference a single trained
        # model.
        # You can use aliases instead of trained model identifiers to make it easier to
        # reference your models. For example, you can use aliases in inference
        # aggregations and processors.
        # An alias must be unique and refer to only a single trained model. However,
        # you can have multiple aliases for each trained model.
        # If you use this API to update an alias such that it references a different
        # trained model ID and the model uses a different type of data frame analytics,
        # an error occurs. For example, this situation occurs if you have a trained
        # model for regression analysis and a trained model for classification
        # analysis; you cannot reassign an alias from one type of trained model to
        # another.
        # If you use this API to update an alias and there are very few input fields in
        # common between the old and new trained models for the model alias, the API
        # returns a warning.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :model_alias The alias to create or update. This value cannot end in numbers. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [String] :model_id The identifier for the trained model that the alias refers to. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :reassign Specifies whether the alias gets reassigned to the specified trained
        #  model if it is already assigned to a different model. If the alias is
        #  already assigned and this parameter is false, the API returns an error.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
