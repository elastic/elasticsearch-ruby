        # Predict future behavior of a time series.
        # Forecasts are not supported for jobs that perform population analysis; an
        # error occurs if you try to create a forecast for a job that has an
        # +over_field_name+ in its configuration. Forcasts predict future behavior
        # based on historical data.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :job_id Identifier for the anomaly detection job. The job must be open when you
        #  create a forecast; otherwise, an error occurs. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Time] :duration A period of time that indicates how far into the future to forecast. For
        #  example, +30d+ corresponds to 30 days. The forecast starts at the last
        #  record that was processed. Server default: 1d.
        # @option arguments [Time] :expires_in The period of time that forecast results are retained. After a forecast
        #  expires, the results are deleted. If set to a value of 0, the forecast is
        #  never automatically deleted. Server default: 14d.
        # @option arguments [String] :max_model_memory The maximum memory the forecast can use. If the forecast needs to use
        #  more than the provided amount, it will spool to disk. Default is 20mb,
        #  maximum is 500mb and minimum is 1mb. If set to 40% or more of the jobâ€™s
        #  configured memory limit, it is automatically reduced to below that
        #  amount. Server default: 20mb.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        # @option arguments [Hash] :body request body
        #
