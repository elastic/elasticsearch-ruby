        # Reroute the cluster.
        # Manually change the allocation of individual shards in the cluster.
        # For example, a shard can be moved from one node to another explicitly, an allocation can be canceled, and an unassigned shard can be explicitly allocated to a specific node.
        # It is important to note that after processing any reroute commands Elasticsearch will perform rebalancing as normal (respecting the values of settings such as +cluster.routing.rebalance.enable+) in order to remain in a balanced state.
        # For example, if the requested allocation includes moving a shard from node1 to node2 then this may cause a shard to be moved from node2 back to node1 to even things out.
        # The cluster can be set to disable allocations using the +cluster.routing.allocation.enable+ setting.
        # If allocations are disabled then the only allocations that will be performed are explicit ones given using the reroute command, and consequent allocations due to rebalancing.
        # The cluster will attempt to allocate a shard a maximum of +index.allocation.max_retries+ times in a row (defaults to +5+), before giving up and leaving the shard unallocated.
        # This scenario can be caused by structural problems such as having an analyzer which refers to a stopwords file which doesnâ€™t exist on all nodes.
        # Once the problem has been corrected, allocation can be manually retried by calling the reroute API with the +?retry_failed+ URI query parameter, which will attempt a single retry round for these shards.
        #
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :dry_run If true, then the request simulates the operation.
        #  It will calculate the result of applying the commands to the current cluster state and return the resulting cluster state after the commands (and rebalancing) have been applied; it will not actually perform the requested changes.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :explain If true, then the response contains an explanation of why the commands can or cannot run.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :metric Limits the information returned to the specified metrics. Server default: all.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :retry_failed If true, then retries allocation of shards that are blocked due to too many subsequent allocation failures.
        # @option arguments [Time] :master_timeout Period to wait for a connection to the master node. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Time] :timeout Period to wait for a response. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        # @option arguments [Hash] :body request body
