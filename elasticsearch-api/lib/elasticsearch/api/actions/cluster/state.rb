        # Get the cluster state.
        # Get comprehensive information about the state of the cluster.
        # The cluster state is an internal data structure which keeps track of a variety of information needed by every node, including the identity and attributes of the other nodes in the cluster; cluster-wide settings; index metadata, including the mapping and settings for each index; the location and status of every shard copy in the cluster.
        # The elected master node ensures that every node in the cluster has a copy of the same cluster state.
        # This API lets you retrieve a representation of this internal state for debugging or diagnostic purposes.
        # You may need to consult the Elasticsearch source code to determine the precise meaning of the response.
        # By default the API will route requests to the elected master node since this node is the authoritative source of cluster states.
        # You can also retrieve the cluster state held on the node handling the API request by adding the `?local=true` query parameter.
        # Elasticsearch may need to expend significant effort to compute a response to this API in larger clusters, and the response may comprise a very large quantity of data.
        # If you use this API repeatedly, your cluster may become unstable.
        # WARNING: The response is a representation of an internal data structure.
        # Its format is not subject to the same compatibility guarantees as other more stable APIs and may change from version to version.
        # Do not query this API using external monitoring tools.
        # Instead, obtain the information you require using other more stable cluster APIs.
        #
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :metric Limit the information returned to the specified metrics
        # @option arguments [String, Array] :index A comma-separated list of index names; use `_all` or empty string to perform the operation on all indices
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :allow_no_indices Whether to ignore if a wildcard indices expression resolves into no concrete indices. (This includes `_all` string or when no indices have been specified) Server default: true.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :expand_wildcards Whether to expand wildcard expression to concrete indices that are open, closed or both.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :flat_settings Return settings in flat format (default: false)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :ignore_unavailable Whether specified concrete indices should be ignored when unavailable (missing or closed)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :local Return local information, do not retrieve the state from master node (default: false)
        # @option arguments [Time] :master_timeout Specify timeout for connection to master Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Integer] :wait_for_metadata_version Wait for the metadata version to be equal or greater than the specified metadata version
        # @option arguments [Time] :wait_for_timeout The maximum time to wait for wait_for_metadata_version before timing out
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
