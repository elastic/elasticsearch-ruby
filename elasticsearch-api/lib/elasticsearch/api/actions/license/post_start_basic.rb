        # Start a basic license.
        # Start an indefinite basic license, which gives access to all the basic features.
        # NOTE: In order to start a basic license, you must not currently have a basic license.
        # If the basic license does not support all of the features that are available with your current license, however, you are notified in the response.
        # You must then re-submit the API request with the `acknowledge` parameter set to `true`.
        # To check the status of your basic license, use the get basic license API.
        #
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :acknowledge whether the user has acknowledged acknowledge messages (default: false)
        # @option arguments [Time] :master_timeout Period to wait for a connection to the master node. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Time] :timeout Period to wait for a response. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
