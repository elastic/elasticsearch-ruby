        # Analyze the index disk usage.
        # Analyze the disk usage of each field of an index or data stream.
        # This API might not support indices created in previous Elasticsearch versions.
        # The result of a small index can be inaccurate as some parts of an index might not be analyzed by the API.
        # NOTE: The total size of fields of the analyzed shards of the index in the response is usually smaller than the index +store_size+ value because some small metadata files are ignored and some parts of data files might not be scanned by the API.
        # Since stored fields are stored together in a compressed format, the sizes of stored fields are also estimates and can be inaccurate.
        # The stored size of the +_id+ field is likely underestimated while the +_source+ field is overestimated.
        # This functionality is Experimental and may be changed or removed
        # completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach
        # to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the
        # support SLA of official GA features.

        # @option arguments [String, Array] :index Comma-separated list of data streams, indices, and aliases used to limit the request.
        #  Itâ€™s recommended to execute this API with a single index (or the latest backing index of a data stream) as the API consumes resources significantly. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :allow_no_indices If false, the request returns an error if any wildcard expression, index alias, or +_all+ value targets only missing or closed indices.
        #  This behavior applies even if the request targets other open indices.
        #  For example, a request targeting +foo*,bar*+ returns an error if an index starts with +foo+ but no index starts with +bar+. Server default: true.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :expand_wildcards Type of index that wildcard patterns can match.
        #  If the request can target data streams, this argument determines whether wildcard expressions match hidden data streams.
        #  Supports comma-separated values, such as +open,hidden+. Server default: open.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :flush If +true+, the API performs a flush before analysis.
        #  If +false+, the response may not include uncommitted data. Server default: true.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :ignore_unavailable If +true+, missing or closed indices are not included in the response.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :run_expensive_tasks Analyzing field disk usage is resource-intensive.
        #  To use the API, this parameter must be set to +true+.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
