        # Convert an index alias to a data stream.
        # Converts an index alias to a data stream.
        # You must have a matching index template that is data stream enabled.
        # The alias must meet the following criteria:
        # The alias must have a write index;
        # All indices for the alias must have a `@timestamp` field mapping of a `date` or `date_nanos` field type;
        # The alias must not have any filters;
        # The alias must not use custom routing.
        # If successful, the request removes the alias and creates a data stream with the same name.
        # The indices for the alias become hidden backing indices for the stream.
        # The write index for the alias becomes the write index for the stream.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :name Name of the index alias to convert to a data stream. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Time] :master_timeout Period to wait for a connection to the master node. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Time] :timeout Period to wait for a response. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
