        # Get field usage stats.
        # Get field usage information for each shard and field of an index.
        # Field usage statistics are automatically captured when queries are running on a cluster.
        # A shard-level search request that accesses a given field, even if multiple times during that request, is counted as a single use.
        # The response body reports the per-shard usage count of the data structures that back the fields in the index.
        # A given request will increment each count by a maximum value of 1, even if the request accesses the same field multiple times.
        # This functionality is Experimental and may be changed or removed
        # completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach
        # to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the
        # support SLA of official GA features.
        #
        # @option arguments [String, Array] :index Comma-separated list or wildcard expression of index names used to limit the request. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :allow_no_indices If `false`, the request returns an error if any wildcard expression, index alias, or `_all` value targets only missing or closed indices.
        #  This behavior applies even if the request targets other open indices.
        #  For example, a request targeting `foo*,bar*` returns an error if an index starts with `foo` but no index starts with `bar`.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :expand_wildcards Type of index that wildcard patterns can match.
        #  If the request can target data streams, this argument determines whether wildcard expressions match hidden data streams.
        #  Supports comma-separated values, such as `open,hidden`.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :ignore_unavailable If `true`, missing or closed indices are not included in the response.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :fields Comma-separated list or wildcard expressions of fields to include in the statistics.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
