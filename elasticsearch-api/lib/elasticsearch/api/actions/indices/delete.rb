        # Delete indices.
        # Deleting an index deletes its documents, shards, and metadata.
        # It does not delete related Kibana components, such as data views, visualizations, or dashboards.
        # You cannot delete the current write index of a data stream.
        # To delete the index, you must roll over the data stream so a new write index is created.
        # You can then use the delete index API to delete the previous write index.
        #
        # @option arguments [String, Array] :index Comma-separated list of indices to delete.
        #  You cannot specify index aliases.
        #  By default, this parameter does not support wildcards (+*+) or +_all+.
        #  To use wildcards or +_all+, set the +action.destructive_requires_name+ cluster setting to +false+. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :allow_no_indices If +false+, the request returns an error if any wildcard expression, index alias, or +_all+ value targets only missing or closed indices.
        #  This behavior applies even if the request targets other open indices. Server default: true.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :expand_wildcards Type of index that wildcard patterns can match.
        #  If the request can target data streams, this argument determines whether wildcard expressions match hidden data streams.
        #  Supports comma-separated values, such as +open,hidden+.
        #  Valid values are: +all+, +open+, +closed+, +hidden+, +none+. Server default: open.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :ignore_unavailable If +false+, the request returns an error if it targets a missing or closed index.
        # @option arguments [Time] :master_timeout Period to wait for a connection to the master node.
        #  If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Time] :timeout Period to wait for a response.
        #  If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
