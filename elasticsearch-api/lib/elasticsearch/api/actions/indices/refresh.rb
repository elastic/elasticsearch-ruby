        # Refresh an index.
        # A refresh makes recent operations performed on one or more indices available for search.
        # For data streams, the API runs the refresh operation on the streamâ€™s backing indices.
        # By default, Elasticsearch periodically refreshes indices every second, but only on indices that have received one search request or more in the last 30 seconds.
        # You can change this default interval with the +index.refresh_interval+ setting.
        # Refresh requests are synchronous and do not return a response until the refresh operation completes.
        # Refreshes are resource-intensive.
        # To ensure good cluster performance, it's recommended to wait for Elasticsearch's periodic refresh rather than performing an explicit refresh when possible.
        # If your application workflow indexes documents and then runs a search to retrieve the indexed document, it's recommended to use the index API's +refresh=wait_for+ query parameter option.
        # This option ensures the indexing operation waits for a periodic refresh before running the search.
        #
        # @option arguments [String, Array] :index Comma-separated list of data streams, indices, and aliases used to limit the request.
        #  Supports wildcards (+*+).
        #  To target all data streams and indices, omit this parameter or use +*+ or +_all+.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :allow_no_indices If +false+, the request returns an error if any wildcard expression, index alias, or +_all+ value targets only missing or closed indices.
        #  This behavior applies even if the request targets other open indices. Server default: true.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :expand_wildcards Type of index that wildcard patterns can match.
        #  If the request can target data streams, this argument determines whether wildcard expressions match hidden data streams.
        #  Supports comma-separated values, such as +open,hidden+.
        #  Valid values are: +all+, +open+, +closed+, +hidden+, +none+. Server default: open.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :ignore_unavailable If +false+, the request returns an error if it targets a missing or closed index.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
