        # Downsample an index.
        # Aggregate a time series (TSDS) index and store pre-computed statistical summaries (`min`, `max`, `sum`, `value_count` and `avg`) for each metric field grouped by a configured time interval.
        # For example, a TSDS index that contains metrics sampled every 10 seconds can be downsampled to an hourly index.
        # All documents within an hour interval are summarized and stored as a single document in the downsample index.
        # NOTE: Only indices in a time series data stream are supported.
        # Neither field nor document level security can be defined on the source index.
        # The source index must be read only (`index.blocks.write: true`).
        # This functionality is Experimental and may be changed or removed
        # completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach
        # to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the
        # support SLA of official GA features.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :index Name of the time series index to downsample. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [String] :target_index Name of the index to create. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        # @option arguments [Hash] :body config
