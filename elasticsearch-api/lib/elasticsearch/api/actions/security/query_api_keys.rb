        # Find API keys with a query.
        # Get a paginated list of API keys and their information.
        # You can optionally filter the results with a query.
        # To use this API, you must have at least the `manage_own_api_key` or the `read_security` cluster privileges.
        # If you have only the `manage_own_api_key` privilege, this API returns only the API keys that you own.
        # If you have the `read_security`, `manage_api_key`, or greater privileges (including `manage_security`), this API returns all API keys regardless of ownership.
        #
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :with_limited_by Return the snapshot of the owner user's role descriptors associated with the API key.
        #  An API key's actual permission is the intersection of its assigned role descriptors and the owner user's role descriptors (effectively limited by it).
        #  An API key cannot retrieve any API keyâ€™s limited-by role descriptors (including itself) unless it has `manage_api_key` or higher privileges.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :with_profile_uid Determines whether to also retrieve the profile UID for the API key owner principal.
        #  If it exists, the profile UID is returned under the `profile_uid` response field for each API key.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :typed_keys Determines whether aggregation names are prefixed by their respective types in the response.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        # @option arguments [Hash] :body request body
        #
