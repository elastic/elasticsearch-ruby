        # Find API keys with a query.
        # Get a paginated list of API keys and their information.
        # You can optionally filter the results with a query.
        # To use this API, you must have at least the +manage_own_api_key+ or the +read_security+ cluster privileges.
        # If you have only the +manage_own_api_key+ privilege, this API returns only the API keys that you own.
        # If you have the +read_security+, +manage_api_key+, or greater privileges (including +manage_security+), this API returns all API keys regardless of ownership.
        #
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :with_limited_by Return the snapshot of the owner user's role descriptors associated with the API key.
        #  An API key's actual permission is the intersection of its assigned role descriptors and the owner user's role descriptors (effectively limited by it).
        #  An API key cannot retrieve any API keyâ€™s limited-by role descriptors (including itself) unless it has +manage_api_key+ or higher privileges.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :with_profile_uid Determines whether to also retrieve the profile UID for the API key owner principal.
        #  If it exists, the profile UID is returned under the +profile_uid+ response field for each API key.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :typed_keys Determines whether aggregation names are prefixed by their respective types in the response.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        # @option arguments [Hash] :body request body
