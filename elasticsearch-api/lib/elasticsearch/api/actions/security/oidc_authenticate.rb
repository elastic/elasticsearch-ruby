        # Authenticate OpenID Connect.
        # Exchange an OpenID Connect authentication response message for an Elasticsearch internal access token and refresh token that can be subsequently used for authentication.
        # Elasticsearch exposes all the necessary OpenID Connect related functionality with the OpenID Connect APIs.
        # These APIs are used internally by Kibana in order to provide OpenID Connect based authentication, but can also be used by other, custom web applications or other clients.
        #
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        # @option arguments [Hash] :body request body
