        # Logout of SAML completely.
        # Verifies the logout response sent from the SAML IdP.
        # NOTE: This API is intended for use by custom web applications other than Kibana.
        # If you are using Kibana, refer to the documentation for configuring SAML single-sign-on on the Elastic Stack.
        # The SAML IdP may send a logout response back to the SP after handling the SP-initiated SAML Single Logout.
        # This API verifies the response by ensuring the content is relevant and validating its signature.
        # An empty response is returned if the verification process is successful.
        # The response can be sent by the IdP with either the HTTP-Redirect or the HTTP-Post binding.
        # The caller of this API must prepare the request accordingly so that this API can handle either of them.

        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        # @option arguments [Hash] :body request body
