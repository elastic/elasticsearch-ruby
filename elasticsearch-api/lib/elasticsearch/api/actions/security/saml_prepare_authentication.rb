        # Prepare SAML authentication.
        # Create a SAML authentication request (`<AuthnRequest>`) as a URL string based on the configuration of the respective SAML realm in Elasticsearch.
        # NOTE: This API is intended for use by custom web applications other than Kibana.
        # If you are using Kibana, refer to the documentation for configuring SAML single-sign-on on the Elastic Stack.
        # This API returns a URL pointing to the SAML Identity Provider.
        # You can use the URL to redirect the browser of the user in order to continue the authentication process.
        # The URL includes a single parameter named `SAMLRequest`, which contains a SAML Authentication request that is deflated and Base64 encoded.
        # If the configuration dictates that SAML authentication requests should be signed, the URL has two extra parameters named `SigAlg` and `Signature`.
        # These parameters contain the algorithm used for the signature and the signature value itself.
        # It also returns a random string that uniquely identifies this SAML Authentication request.
        # The caller of this API needs to store this identifier as it needs to be used in a following step of the authentication process.
        #
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        # @option arguments [Hash] :body request body
