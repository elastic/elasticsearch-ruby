        # Enable a user profile.
        # Enable user profiles to make them visible in user profile searches.
        # NOTE: The user profile feature is designed only for use by Kibana and Elastic's Observability, Enterprise Search, and Elastic Security solutions.
        # Individual users and external applications should not call this API directly.
        # Elastic reserves the right to change or remove this feature in future releases without prior notice.
        # When you activate a user profile, it's automatically enabled and visible in user profile searches.
        # If you later disable the user profile, you can use the enable user profile API to make the profile visible in these searches again.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :uid A unique identifier for the user profile. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [String] :refresh If 'true', Elasticsearch refreshes the affected shards to make this operation
        #  visible to search.
        #  If 'wait_for', it waits for a refresh to make this operation visible to search.
        #  If 'false', nothing is done with refreshes. Server default: false.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
