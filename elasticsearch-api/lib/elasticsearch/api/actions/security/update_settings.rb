        # Update security index settings.
        # Update the user-configurable settings for the security internal index (`.security` and associated indices). Only a subset of settings are allowed to be modified. This includes `index.auto_expand_replicas` and `index.number_of_replicas`.
        # NOTE: If `index.auto_expand_replicas` is set, `index.number_of_replicas` will be ignored during updates.
        # If a specific index is not in use on the system and settings are provided for it, the request will be rejected.
        # This API does not yet support configuring the settings for indices before they are in use.

        #  If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error.
        # @option arguments [Time] :timeout The period to wait for a response.
        #  If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        # @option arguments [Hash] :body request body
