        # Disable a user profile.
        # Disable user profiles so that they are not visible in user profile searches.
        # NOTE: The user profile feature is designed only for use by Kibana and Elastic's Observability, Enterprise Search, and Elastic Security solutions.
        # Individual users and external applications should not call this API directly.
        # Elastic reserves the right to change or remove this feature in future releases without prior notice.
        # When you activate a user profile, its automatically enabled and visible in user profile searches. You can use the disable user profile API to disable a user profile so itâ€™s not visible in these searches.
        # To re-enable a disabled user profile, use the enable user profile API .
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :uid Unique identifier for the user profile. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [String] :refresh If 'true', Elasticsearch refreshes the affected shards to make this operation visible to search.
        #  If 'wait_for', it waits for a refresh to make this operation visible to search.
        #  If 'false', it does nothing with refreshes. Server default: false.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
