        # Create a cross-cluster API key.
        # Create an API key of the +cross_cluster+ type for the API key based remote cluster access.
        # A +cross_cluster+ API key cannot be used to authenticate through the REST interface.
        # IMPORTANT: To authenticate this request you must use a credential that is not an API key. Even if you use an API key that has the required privilege, the API returns an error.
        # Cross-cluster API keys are created by the Elasticsearch API key service, which is automatically enabled.
        # NOTE: Unlike REST API keys, a cross-cluster API key does not capture permissions of the authenticated user. The API keyâ€™s effective permission is exactly as specified with the +access+ property.
        # A successful request returns a JSON structure that contains the API key, its unique ID, and its name. If applicable, it also returns expiration information for the API key in milliseconds.
        # By default, API keys never expire. You can specify expiration information when you create the API keys.
        # Cross-cluster API keys can only be updated with the update cross-cluster API key API.
        # Attempting to update them with the update REST API key API or the bulk update REST API keys API will result in an error.
