        # Move to a lifecycle step.
        # Manually move an index into a specific step in the lifecycle policy and run that step.
        # WARNING: This operation can result in the loss of data. Manually moving an index into a specific step runs that step even if it has already been performed. This is a potentially destructive action and this should be considered an expert level API.
        # You must specify both the current step and the step to be executed in the body of the request.
        # The request will fail if the current step does not match the step currently running for the index
        # This is to prevent the index from being moved from an unexpected step into the next step.
        # When specifying the target (`next_step`) to which the index will be moved, either the name or both the action and name fields are optional.
        # If only the phase is specified, the index will move to the first step of the first action in the target phase.
        # If the phase and action are specified, the index will move to the first step of the specified action in the specified phase.
        # Only actions specified in the ILM policy are considered valid.
        # An index cannot move to a step that is not part of its policy.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :index The name of the index whose lifecycle step is to change (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        # @option arguments [Hash] :body request body
