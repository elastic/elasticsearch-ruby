        # Explain the lifecycle state.
        # Get the current lifecycle status for one or more indices.
        # For data streams, the API retrieves the current lifecycle status for the stream's backing indices.
        # The response indicates when the index entered each lifecycle state, provides the definition of the running phase, and information about any failures.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :index Comma-separated list of data streams, indices, and aliases to target. Supports wildcards (`*`).
        #  To target all data streams and indices, use `*` or `_all`. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :only_errors Filters the returned indices to only indices that are managed by ILM and are in an error state, either due to an encountering an error while executing the policy, or attempting to use a policy that does not exist.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :only_managed Filters the returned indices to only indices that are managed by ILM.
        # @option arguments [Time] :master_timeout Period to wait for a connection to the master node. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
