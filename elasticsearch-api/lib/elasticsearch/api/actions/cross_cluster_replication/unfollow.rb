        # Unfollow an index.
        # Convert a cross-cluster replication follower index to a regular index.
        # The API stops the following task associated with a follower index and removes index metadata and settings associated with cross-cluster replication.
        # The follower index must be paused and closed before you call the unfollow API.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :index The name of the follower index. (*Required*)
        # @option arguments [Time] :master_timeout The period to wait for a connection to the master node.
        #  If the master node is not available before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error.
        #  It can also be set to `-1` to indicate that the request should never timeout. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
