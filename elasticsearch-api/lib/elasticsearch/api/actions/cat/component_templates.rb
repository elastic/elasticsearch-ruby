        # Get component templates.
        # Get information about component templates in a cluster.
        # Component templates are building blocks for constructing index templates that specify index mappings, settings, and aliases.
        # IMPORTANT: CAT APIs are only intended for human consumption using the command line or Kibana console.
        # They are not intended for use by applications. For application consumption, use the get component template API.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :name The name of the component template.
        #  It accepts wildcard expressions.
        #  If it is omitted, all component templates are returned.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :h A comma-separated list of columns names to display. It supports simple wildcards.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :s List of columns that determine how the table should be sorted.
        #  Sorting defaults to ascending and can be changed by setting `:asc`
        #  or `:desc` as a suffix to the column name.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :local If `true`, the request computes the list of selected nodes from the
        #  local cluster state. If `false` the list of selected nodes are computed
        #  from the cluster state of the master node. In both cases the coordinating
        #  node will send requests for further information to each selected node.
        # @option arguments [Time] :master_timeout The period to wait for a connection to the master node. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [String] :format Specifies the format to return the columnar data in, can be set to
        #  `text`, `json`, `cbor`, `yaml`, or `smile`. Server default: text.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :help When set to `true` will output available columns. This option
        #  can't be combined with any other query string option.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :v When set to `true` will enable verbose output.
        # @option arguments [String] :bytes Sets the units for columns that contain a byte-size value.
        #  Note that byte-size value units work in terms of powers of 1024. For instance `1kb` means 1024 bytes, not 1000 bytes.
        #  If omitted, byte-size values are rendered with a suffix such as `kb`, `mb`, or `gb`, chosen such that the numeric value of the column is as small as possible whilst still being at least `1.0`.
        #  If given, byte-size values are rendered as an integer with no suffix, representing the value of the column in the chosen unit.
        #  Values that are not an exact multiple of the chosen unit are rounded down.
        # @option arguments [String] :time Sets the units for columns that contain a time duration.
        #  If omitted, time duration values are rendered with a suffix such as `ms`, `s`, `m` or `h`, chosen such that the numeric value of the column is as small as possible whilst still being at least `1.0`.
        #  If given, time duration values are rendered as an integer with no suffix.
        #  Values that are not an exact multiple of the chosen unit are rounded down.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
        # @see https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cat-component-templates
