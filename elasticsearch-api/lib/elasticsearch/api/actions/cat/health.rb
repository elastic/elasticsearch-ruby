module Elasticsearch

        # Get the cluster health status.
        # IMPORTANT: CAT APIs are only intended for human consumption using the command line or Kibana console.
        # They are not intended for use by applications. For application consumption, use the cluster health API.
        # This API is often used to check malfunctioning clusters.
        # To help you track cluster health alongside log files and alerting systems, the API returns timestamps in two formats:
        # `HH:MM:SS`, which is human-readable but includes no date information;
        # `Unix epoch time`, which is machine-sortable and includes date information.
        # The latter format is useful for cluster recoveries that take multiple days.
        # You can use the cat health API to verify cluster health across multiple nodes.
        # You also can use the API to track the recovery of a large cluster over a longer period of time.
        #
        # @option arguments [String] :time The unit used to display time values.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :ts If true, returns `HH:MM:SS` and Unix epoch timestamps. Server default: true.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :h List of columns to appear in the response. Supports simple wildcards.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :s List of columns that determine how the table should be sorted.
        #  Sorting defaults to ascending and can be changed by setting `:asc`
        #  or `:desc` as a suffix to the column name.
        # @option arguments [String] :format Specifies the format to return the columnar data in, can be set to
        #  `text`, `json`, `cbor`, `yaml`, or `smile`. Server default: text.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :help When set to `true` will output available columns. This option
        #  can't be combined with any other query string option.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :v When set to `true` will enable verbose output.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
        #  when they occur.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
        #  returned by Elasticsearch.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
        #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
        #  `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
        #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
        #  only by machines.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
        #  this option for debugging only.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
        #
        # @see https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cat-health
