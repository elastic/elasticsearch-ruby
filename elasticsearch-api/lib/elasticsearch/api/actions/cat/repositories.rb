        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :h List of columns to appear in the response. Supports simple wildcards.
        # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :s List of columns that determine how the table should be sorted.
        #  Sorting defaults to ascending and can be changed by setting +:asc+
        #  or +:desc+ as a suffix to the column name.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :local If +true+, the request computes the list of selected nodes from the
        #  local cluster state. If +false+ the list of selected nodes are computed
        #  from the cluster state of the master node. In both cases the coordinating
        #  node will send requests for further information to each selected node.
        # @option arguments [Time] :master_timeout Period to wait for a connection to the master node. Server default: 30s.
        # @option arguments [String] :format Specifies the format to return the columnar data in, can be set to
        #  +text+, +json+, +cbor+, +yaml+, or +smile+. Server default: text.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :help When set to +true+ will output available columns. This option
        #  can't be combined with any other query string option.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :v When set to +true+ will enable verbose output.
        # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
