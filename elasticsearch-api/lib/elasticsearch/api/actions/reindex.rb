module Elasticsearch
  module API
    module Actions
      # Allows to copy documents from one index to another, optionally filtering the source
      # documents by a query, changing the destination index settings, or fetching the
      # documents from a remote cluster.
      #
      # @option arguments [Boolean] :refresh Should the affected indexes be refreshed?
      # @option arguments [Time] :timeout Time each individual bulk request should wait for shards that are unavailable.
      # @option arguments [String] :wait_for_active_shards Sets the number of shard copies that must be active before proceeding with the reindex operation. Defaults to 1, meaning the primary shard only. Set to `all` for all shard copies, otherwise set to any non-negative value less than or equal to the total number of copies for the shard (number of replicas + 1)
      # @option arguments [Boolean] :wait_for_completion Should the request should block until the reindex is complete.
      # @option arguments [Number] :requests_per_second The throttle to set on this request in sub-requests per second. -1 means no throttle.
      # @option arguments [Time] :scroll Control how long to keep the search context alive
      # @option arguments [Number|string] :slices The number of slices this task should be divided into. Defaults to 1, meaning the task isn't sliced into subtasks. Can be set to `auto`.
      # @option arguments [Number] :max_docs Maximum number of documents to process (default: all documents)
      # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
      # @option arguments [Hash] :body The search definition using the Query DSL and the prototype for the index request. (*Required*)
      #
      # @see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.10/docs-reindex.html
