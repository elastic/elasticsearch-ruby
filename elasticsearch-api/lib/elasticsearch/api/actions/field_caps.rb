      # Get the field capabilities.
      # Get information about the capabilities of fields among multiple indices.
      # For data streams, the API returns field capabilities among the streamâ€™s backing indices.
      # It returns runtime fields like any other field.
      # For example, a runtime field with a type of keyword is returned the same as any other field that belongs to the `keyword` family.
      #
      # @option arguments [String, Array] :index A comma-separated list of data streams, indices, and aliases used to limit the request. Supports wildcards (*). To target all data streams and indices, omit this parameter or use * or _all.
      # @option arguments [Boolean] :allow_no_indices If false, the request returns an error if any wildcard expression, index alias,
      #  or `_all` value targets only missing or closed indices. This behavior applies even if the request targets other open indices. For example, a request
      #  targeting `foo*,bar*` returns an error if an index starts with foo but no index starts with bar. Server default: true.
      # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :expand_wildcards The type of index that wildcard patterns can match. If the request can target data streams, this argument determines whether wildcard expressions match hidden data streams. Supports comma-separated values, such as `open,hidden`. Server default: open.
      # @option arguments [String, Array<String>] :fields A comma-separated list of fields to retrieve capabilities for. Wildcard (`*`) expressions are supported.
      # @option arguments [Boolean] :ignore_unavailable If `true`, missing or closed indices are not included in the response.
      # @option arguments [Boolean] :include_unmapped If true, unmapped fields are included in the response.
      # @option arguments [String] :filters A comma-separated list of filters to apply to the response.
      # @option arguments [Array<String>] :types A comma-separated list of field types to include.
      #  Any fields that do not match one of these types will be excluded from the results.
      #  It defaults to empty, meaning that all field types are returned.
      # @option arguments [Boolean] :include_empty_fields If false, empty fields are not included in the response. Server default: true.
      # @option arguments [Boolean] :error_trace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
      #  when they occur.
      # @option arguments [String] :filter_path Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
      #  returned by Elasticsearch.
      # @option arguments [Boolean] :human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
      #  For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
      #  `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
      #  readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
      #  only by machines.
      # @option arguments [Boolean] :pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
      #  this option for debugging only.
      # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
      # @option arguments [Hash] :body request body
      #
