# Elasticsearch

This repository contains Ruby integrations for [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).

[![master](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/workflows/master/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/actions) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby)

The [`elasticsearch`](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/master/elasticsearch)
library is a wrapper for two separate libraries:

* [`elasticsearch-transport`](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/master/elasticsearch-transport),
  which provides a low-level Ruby client for connecting to an Elasticsearch cluster
* [`elasticsearch-api`](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/master/elasticsearch-api),
  which provides a Ruby API for the Elasticsearch RESTful API

```ruby
require 'elasticsearch'

client = Elasticsearch::Client.new log: true

# if you specify Elasticsearch host
# client = Elasticsearch::Client.new url: 'http://localhost:9200', log: true

client.transport.reload_connections!

client.cluster.health

client.search q: 'test'

# etc.
```

Both of these libraries are extensively documented.
**Please read the [`elasticsearch-transport`](http://rubydoc.info/gems/elasticsearch-transport) and the [`elasticsearch-api`](http://rubydoc.info/gems/elasticsearch-api) documentation carefully.**

See also [`doc/examples`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/blob/master/docs/examples/README.md) for some practical examples.

**For optimal performance, you should use a HTTP library which supports persistent
("keep-alive") connections, e.g. [Patron](https://github.com/toland/patron) or [Typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus).** These libraries are not dependencies of the Elasticsearch gems. Ensure you define a dependency for a HTTP library in your own application.

This repository contains these additional Ruby libraries:

* [`elasticsearch-extensions`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/master/elasticsearch-extensions), *deprecated*.
* [`elasticsearch-dsl`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/master/elasticsearch-dsl),
  which provides a Ruby API for the [Elasticsearch Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html),

Please see their respective READMEs for information and documentation.

For integration with Ruby models and Rails applications,
see the **[elasticsearch-rails](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails)** project.

## Compatibility

The Elasticsearch client is compatible with currently maintained Ruby versions. See [Ruby Maintenance Branches](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/). We don't provide support to versions which have reached their end of life.

The gem's version numbers follow Elasticsearch's major versions. The `master` branch is compatible with the Elasticsearch `master` branch, which is the next major version.

Use a release that matches the major version of Elasticsearch in your stack. Each client version is backwards compatible with all minor versions of the same major version. The client's API is compatible with Elasticsearch's API versions from 0.90 till current.

Check out [Elastic product end of life dates](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol) to learn which releases are still actively supported and tested.

## Installation

Install the `elasticsearch` package from [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/elasticsearch):

    gem install elasticsearch

To use an unreleased version, either add it to your `Gemfile` for [Bundler](http://gembundler.com):

    gem 'elasticsearch', git: 'git://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby.git'

or install it from a source code checkout:

    git clone https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby.git
    cd elasticsearch-ruby/elasticsearch
    bundle install
    rake install

## Development

To work on the code, clone and bootstrap the project first:

```
git clone https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby.git
cd elasticsearch-ruby/
bundle exec rake setup
bundle exec rake bundle
```

This will clone the Elasticsearch repository into the project, and run `bundle install` in all subprojects. There are a few tasks to work with Elasticsearch. Use `rake -T` and look for the tasks in the `elasticsearch` namespace. You can build elasticsearch with `rake elasticsearch:build` after having ran setup.

To run tests, you need to start a testing cluster on port 9250, or provide a different one in the `TEST_CLUSTER_PORT` environment variable.

There's a Rake task to start a testing cluster in a Docker container:

`rake docker:start[version]` - E.g.: `rake docker:start[7.x-SNAPSHOT]`. To start the container with Platinum, pass it in as a parameter: `rake docker:start[7.x-SNAPSHOT,xpack]`.

To run tests against unreleased Elasticsearch versions, you can use the `rake elasticsearch:build` Rake task to build Elasticsearch from the cloned source (use `rake elasticsearch:update` to update the repository):

**Note:** If you have gems from the `elasticsearch` family installed system-wide, and want to use development ones, prepend the command with `bundle exec`.

```
rake elasticsearch:build
```

This is going to create the build in `./tmp/builds/`.

You can pass a branch name (tag, commit, ...) as the Rake task variable:

```
rake elasticsearch:build[origin/1.x]
```

To run all the tests in all the subprojects, use the Rake task:

```
time rake test:client
```

By default, tests will atempt to use `http://localhost:9200` as a test server. If you're using a different host/port, set the `TEST_ES_SERVER` environment variable, e.g.:

```
$ TEST_ES_SERVER='http://localhost:9250' be rake test:client
```
