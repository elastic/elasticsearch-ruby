# Elasticsearch

This repository contains Ruby integrations for [Elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org):

* a client for connecting to an Elasticsearch cluster,
* a Ruby API for the Elasticsearch's REST API,
* various extensions and utilities.

## Compatibility

The libraries are compatible with Ruby 1.8.7 and higher.

The library is compatible with Elasticsearch 0.90 and 1.0 -- you have to install and use a matching version, though.

The 1.0 pre-release version and the master branch are compatible with **Elasticsearch 1.0** API.

To use the **Elasticsearch 0.90** API, install the **0.4.x** gem version or use the corresponding
[`0.4`](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/0.4) branch.

## Installation

Install the `elasticsearch` package from [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/elasticsearch):

    gem install elasticsearch

To use an unreleased version, either add it to your `Gemfile` for [Bundler](http://gembundler.com):

    gem 'elasticsearch', github: 'elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby'

or install it from a source code checkout:

    git clone https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby.git
    cd elasticsearch-ruby/elasticsearch
    bundle install
    rake install

## Usage

The [`elasticsearch`](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/master/elasticsearch)
library is a wrapper for two separate libraries:

* [`elasticsearch-transport`](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/master/elasticsearch-transport),
  which provides a low-level Ruby client for connecting to an [Elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org) cluster
* [`elasticsearch-api`](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/master/elasticsearch-api),
  which provides a Ruby API for the Elasticsearch RESTful API

```ruby
require 'elasticsearch'

client = Elasticsearch::Client.new log: true

client.transport.reload_connections!

client.cluster.health

client.search q: 'test'

# etc.
```

Please refer to the specific library documentation for detailed information and examples.
