        # A query which executes the search for low frequency terms first, and high frequency ("common")
        # terms second
        #
        # @example
        #
        #     search do
        #       query do
        #         common :body do
        #           query 'shakespeare to be or not to be'
        #         end
        #       end
        #     end
        #
        # This query is frequently used when a stopwords-based approach loses too much recall and/or precision.
        #
