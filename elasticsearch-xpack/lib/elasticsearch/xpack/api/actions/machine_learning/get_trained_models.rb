          # Retrieves configuration information for a trained inference model.
          # This functionality is Experimental and may be changed or removed
          # completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach
          # to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the
          # support SLA of official GA features.

          # @option arguments [String] :model_id The ID of the trained models to fetch
          # @option arguments [Boolean] :allow_no_match Whether to ignore if a wildcard expression matches no trained models. (This includes `_all` string or when no trained models have been specified)
          # @option arguments [String] :include A comma-separate list of fields to optionally include. Valid options are 'definition' and 'total_feature_importance'. Default is none.
          # @option arguments [Boolean] :include_model_definition Should the full model definition be included in the results. These definitions can be large. So be cautious when including them. Defaults to false. *Deprecated*
          # @option arguments [Boolean] :decompress_definition Should the model definition be decompressed into valid JSON or returned in a custom compressed format. Defaults to true.
          # @option arguments [Int] :from skips a number of trained models
          # @option arguments [Int] :size specifies a max number of trained models to get
          # @option arguments [List] :tags A comma-separated list of tags that the model must have.
          # @option arguments [Boolean] :for_export Omits fields that are illegal to set on model PUT
          # @option arguments [Hash] :headers Custom HTTP headers
