      #
      #     class MyTest <Â Test::Unit::TestCase
      #       extend Elasticsearch::Extensions::Test::StartupShutdown
      #
      #       startup  { puts "Suite starting up..." }

      # *** IMPORTANT NOTE: **********************************************************
      #
      # You have to register the handler for shutdown before requiring 'test/unit':

      # The API follows Test::Unit 2.0
